# U8G2 Display Implementation for CarRadio

This document explains the changes made to fix the U8G2 display integration in the CarRadio project.

## Files Created

1. `src/U8G2_VFD_fixed.hpp` - Fixed implementation of the U8G2 VFD class
2. `src/u8g2_hw_i2c_fixed.cpp` - Hardware I2C implementation for U8G2 on Linux

## Implementation Details

### U8G2_VFD_fixed.hpp

This file provides a complete implementation of the VFD interface using the U8G2 library. The following issues have been fixed:

1. **Function Signature Mismatches**: All method signatures now match the VFD base class.
2. **Return Type Corrections**: `width()` and `height()` now return `uint16_t` instead of `uint8_t`.
3. **I2C Initialization**: Properly initializes I2C with the correct device address.
4. **Hardware I2C Implementation**: Added proper hardware I2C callback implementation.
5. **GPIO Message Handling**: Added proper GPIO message handling for the U8G2 library.

### u8g2_hw_i2c_fixed.cpp

This file provides the hardware I2C implementation for the U8G2 library on Linux. It:

1. Opens the I2C device
2. Sets the I2C slave address
3. Handles I2C data transfer
4. Provides proper error handling

## How to Implement These Changes

To implement these changes on your Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. SSH into your Raspberry Pi
ssh pi@your-raspberry-pi-ip

# 2. Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/carradio

# 3. Rename the fixed files to replace the original files
mv src/U8G2_VFD_fixed.hpp src/U8G2_VFD.hpp
mv src/u8g2_hw_i2c_fixed.cpp src/u8g2_hw_i2c.cpp

# 4. Update CMakeLists.txt to include the new u8g2_hw_i2c.cpp file
# Add the following line to your CMakeLists.txt in the appropriate location:
# src/u8g2_hw_i2c.cpp

# 5. Make sure the u8g2 library is installed
# If not already installed, run:
git clone https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2.git
cd u8g2/csrc
sudo cp *.h /usr/local/include/
sudo cp *.c /usr/local/src/

# 6. Install required I2C development libraries
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libi2c-dev i2c-tools

# 7. Build the project
cd path/to/carradio
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Testing the Display

After implementing these changes, you can test the display with:

```bash
# Enable I2C if not already enabled
sudo raspi-config
# Navigate to: Interface Options > I2C > Enable

# Check if the I2C device is detected
sudo i2cdetect -y 1

# Run your application
./carradio
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Display Not Detected**: Check I2C connections and address (default is 0x3C)
2. **Compilation Errors**: Ensure all U8G2 library files are properly installed
3. **I2C Permission Issues**: Make sure your user has permission to access I2C devices
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G i2c,dialout $USER
   ```

## Notes on Implementation

- The implementation uses the SSD1306 128x64 OLED display driver by default
- Font mappings are approximated to match the original VFD implementation
- The hardware I2C implementation is specific to Linux systems with I2C support
- The default I2C device is `/dev/i2c-1`, which is standard for Raspberry Pi 3 and 4
